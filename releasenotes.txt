2015_09_19 - 20 software
- new image class to store / draw images
- new image button class
- new GUI with beautiful icons
- faster tap / display / sensors action
- calibration function for touchscreen linked to IDs
- wlan free APs bug fixed
- wlan connectivity fixed
- reports successfully sent to uradmonitor.com server. Added basic upload support for D models on server side: TODO: proper E2 protocol POST uploads
- new Dosimeter and AirQ pages
- alarms for all parameters
- air quality formula based on vocs, dust, co2 and humi , with pondered average, log10 and scale
- black theme
- new Measure page with improvements on the charts: TODO: do a single chart window, bigger, like in the AirQ page

- change 16Mhz crystal caps to 12pF . Having them on 22pF caused lots of unpredictable issues.

2015_08_19 enclosure
- new enclosure V102, to adapt for the new LCD connector, designed in autocad for machine compatibility
- negociations with Chinese aluminium enclosure manufacturers

2015_08_15 pcb
- reworking the pcb v102 for the following changes: drop 5V boost converter, change ams1117 regulator to high efficienty LTC3440 boost/buck converter for 3.3V output, 
drop p-ch mosfet and directly control power using the LTC chip, add voltage multiplier to the high voltage inverter so we can jump from 3.3 directly to 500 or more,
change ISP to 6 pins connector, new LCD connector, EEPROM chip

2015_08_14 pcb
- sourcing components for following hardware changes (v102)

2015_08_11 beta release
- user interface
- charts
- class for GUI to separate from main
- buttons class
- sounds, alarm, backlight timeout, power sequence
- GUI organised in pages
- titlebar with time, battery and alert
- at quick dirty parser for esp8266

- troubleshooting: ADC PF7, PF6 , PF5 didn't work due to the JTAG being enabled. Disabling it in code.s
- added the high voltage inverter class. Some updates for setting the parameters in the constructor (pwm frequency, duty cycle), and a few getters for this params.
- investigates duty cycle vs. frequency vs. output voltage and draw some charts to ilustrate the results. Surprisingly, entering audible frequency interval will not produce the high pitched sound, but getting under 8KHz will result in heating of the HV Inverter ferrite core and inductor. Opted to go for 12500Hz for now (uradmonitor model A uses 15.5KHz)
- in model A, we adjust the duty cycle to match the target voltage with a given tolerance (2-5V). If for some reason we failed to reach the voltage and the duty cycle reached maximum, we would enter a soft reset (reboot of the unit). Here things are different. As we now need higher voltage (450-500V for the LND712), we risk aproaching the max duty cycle value, where the voltage increase is no longer linear, and we risk missing the hotspot. We can't reset either, as we have a user looking at the screen, and we're not just a monitor. So we remember the highest voltage reached, and we return to that area, since it's most likely the ferrite core will do its best there (instead of at the end  of the allowed duty cycle interval). Also remember that we are using a second pull down transistor connected to the main switching transistor, so going up to 80-90% duty cycles is perfectly fine.

Geiger tubes LND712 arrived. Tests shown the invertor topology used in uRADMonitor model A (5V -> 380V) can be used for the new target voltage without any hardware modifications (the boost converter can be configured in software to go as high as 550V). We'll use 450V which is at the inferior limit of the LND712's working interval, just ot be on the safe side.
