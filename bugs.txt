PF7,PF6,PF5 (touchscreen and battery monitor) were not working, because they were used by JTAG.
Had to disable JTAG in code: 	MCUCSR |=(1<<JTD);

The inverter running on battery was charging the battery. Had to cut the 5V trace. A proper fix is adding a diode after the FTDI circuit. Current from inverter should only go to 500V inverter and to 3.3regulator
3.3V regulator is overheating. Some filter caps seemed to help but not entirely. This must be replacest by a step down converter.

BMP180 code stopped working. This was actually caused by the MiCS-VZ-89 failure, bringing down the entire I2C line.

ILI9341 touch driver failure. LCD connector failure. No LCDs left. Package from China brought a few new ones in time, but with no touchscreen.
I was able to find some different touchscreen replacements, dropped the driver to implement the detection mechanism in avr.

Atmega128 seems to manifest weird behaviour with a simple LED code: direct PIN code works, while the DigitalPin class doesn't. Apparently this was related to avrdude, altering the firmware code during upload.

LCD code is not running. I assumed that the LCD was burned by using 5V. False, the avrdude had issued properly writting the firmware to the mega128
